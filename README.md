# Menu-Builder
Ethan, Austin, Joe

Build a menu with recipes from the Edamam recipe search database.

## Build Notes
For access to the Edamam API, it is necessary to include a file under src/main/resources named api.txt.
It must contain the app ID on the first line and the API key for recipe search on the second.

For example,
```
abcd1234
abdce01234fghij56789
```

If the file is not present, you should get an assertion error.
